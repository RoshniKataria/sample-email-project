Please proceed with copying the CFT into your repository.
Starting with the January release, all IAM service roles will be moved out of the development repositories, including future releases.
Pending tasks for ENX: The migration of IAM service roles for eZe and Vet via the manifest is still in progress.
All AM roles will now be managed solely through the SC process.
Since there are still some pending environments, your changes won’t be affected for the time being.
Continue to follow the same process as you do for other infrastructure components.
Ensure that all changes go through the appropriate release branches.
Test and validate all changes across every environment, and continue promotions up to eZe for now. We’ll decide next steps after that.
Please share the AD group request and feature details, so I can create the corresponding JIRAs.
Let me know if anything needs further clarification.
