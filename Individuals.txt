Challenge: I took on the challenge of optimizing the service quota monitoring job by modifying the existing code to run in parallel. The original code was lengthy and well-structured but required improvements for better efficiency. Additionally, I challenged myself to execute AWS CLI commands through a Python script. Despite the complexities of working within Barclays' proxy environment, I successfully connected using the Boto3 module to interact with AWS services.

Speak Up: Throughout discussions, I consistently shared my thoughts and contributed valuable input. I provided enhanced solutions, offering a more efficient and technically sound approach to improve the overall process.

Additionally, I have actively participated in ROTA calls and consistently responded to them in a timely manner. I provided effective solutions during these calls, ensuring prompt resolution of issues as they arose.


Manifest-Based Deployments Enhancements:
Improved the sync-manifest pipeline by introducing a ForceSync option. Components not present in production are now skipped during syncing via E2E, and I refined the function logic for efficiency.
Enhanced the update-manifest-keys pipeline to support updating keys for multiple resources simultaneously. Introduced the AllEnvironmentsUpdate option, which allows updating keys across all environment .json files in a single operation.
Added support for deployment types in the update-manifest-keys pipeline, introducing the key deployment_type to facilitate transitions such as EZE CET → SC.
Modified the common-sc-provision-with-artifactname and other deployment pipelines to include variables like varEnvironment, varAccountID, and varRegion in the SC params JSON, reducing the need for multiple SC param JSON files.
Added a deploymentRequired tag, allowing resources to be conditionally skipped if they do not require deployment or version changes during a release.
Created detailed Confluence pages listing all the manifest-based deployment pipelines, with information on parameters, pipeline functionality, and links.
Service Quota Monitor Solution Enhancements:
Created a confluenceWrite pipeline that updates Confluence pages with monitored quotas, and built a dashboard that runs every Monday at 7 AM IST to keep track of the quotas.
Integrated Confluence page updates into the main pipeline, allowing domain teams to monitor quotas on specific Confluence pages.
Added functionality to include Barclays Logo and Powered By images in Jenkins email notifications.
Expanded the existing solution by adding 30+ new quotas.
Introduced parallel execution in the pipeline, reducing execution time by 3 hours across all domains.
Segregated Subnet IDs based on Availability Zones, helping identify which subnet belongs to which AZ.
Created detailed Confluence pages for the service quota monitoring solution, explaining implementation and functionality, and conducted numerous demo sessions for various teams (Proman, EDP, etc.).
Drafted a Whitepaper for the Service Quota Monitoring solution, currently under review, along with documentation to be published on the DevHub platform.
Application Deployment (ADD) Solution Enhancements:
Implemented various improvements in the ADD pipeline, including colored schemes to highlight failed and passed resources in both pre-check and post-check reports.
Enhanced email communication with more context, such as branch name and environment in subject lines, and ensured reports are sent immediately after pre-checks.
Streamlined the communication process for release success/failure using a single pipeline run.
Modified report subjects to include statuses like success or failure and added detailed reporting for each pipeline stage (pre-checks, deployment, post-checks).
Ensured communication for failures at any stage is promptly sent with relevant details and approval links.
Updated the python-lambda-glue-deploy-job pipeline to support fetching template files for Glue applications and pushing Glue scripts from Nexus to S3.
Created a new pipeline, python-lambda-glue-sc-provision, supporting SC Glue product provisioning.
Added continuous build and deploy support for Glue applications in the manifest-based deployment pipelines.
AWS Cloud Inventory Comparison Pipeline:
Developed a Jenkins pipeline called aws-cloud-inventory-comparison that allows comparing services like ECS and Lambda across different environments. The comparison checks attributes like version, app image (for ECS), name, and runtime.
Created a Python script for comparing two CSV files and publishing the results as an Excel sheet to a Confluence page.
Throughout these efforts, I have consistently optimized processes, engineered effective solutions, and contributed to knowledge sharing via Confluence pages and demo sessions

I have consistently motivated my colleagues to perform at their best, encouraging them to embody Barclays' values and mindset in all their tasks. I have taken an active role in grooming junior team members, particularly Vishal, to whom I explained the company culture and project details, helping him acclimate to our environment.

I have always encouraged my teammates to focus on their personal and professional development, often suggesting they explore new technologies such as GenAI and Machine Learning to enhance their skill sets.

I’ve also supported colleagues like Himanshu, Veeramani, Anjali, and Vishal whenever they needed assistance with tasks, ensuring that I delivered help promptly and contributed to their success.
