                            I hope this email finds you well! My name is Roshni Kataria, and I'm an Instagram influencer specialising in cafe/restaurant reviews. I recently came across your profile and was impressed by the vibrant atmosphere and cozy vibes you bring to the city.<br><br>
                            I'd love the opportunity to visit your place, experience its unique ambiance, and share my review with my 15k+ engaged viewers on Instagram. Would you be open to collaborating on a feature?<br><br>
                            Looking forward to the possibility of working together! <br><br>
                            Best regards,<br>
                            Roshni Kataria<br>
